### The "keylogger.py" and "send_email.py" scripts record keystrokes followed by sending by email. "keylogger.py" uses pynput to log keystrokes, stores the data, and once it has logged 10 keystrokes, formats that information into a message. "send_email.py" handles sending this email using a secure connection with Gmail.
